This folder contains the core classes in sitar.
The main classes are as follows:

	object 
		Base class to all other classes (such as net, module, ports).
		Has an instance id, a hierarchical id, and a pointer to the
		parent module. 
	
	net
		A net is a channel of communication
		between modules. A net provides a fixed size
		FIFO buffering for tokens (which are packets of 
		information). Modules can push/pull
		tokens from a net.


	inort,outport
		Interface between module and net

	module
		Behavioral entity in the system

	time 
		Time is cycle-based, each cycle
		consists of two phases, phase 0 
		and phase 1

	token 
		A token is a packet of information transfered 
		from one module to another. Tokens have 
		information fields such as sender, receiver and ID
		in addition to a payload. Tokens have a parameter 'width'
		which is the size of the payload in Bytes.
